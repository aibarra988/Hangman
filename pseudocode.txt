// Output game screen with: 
    - Greeting (press any key when ready)
    - A magic word ready to be guessed on (show word as underscores)

// When a user presses a key:
    // if the user has available guesses remaining and the magic word has not been revealed
        
        // Check the user's guess against the word

        // if the user's guess matches a letter in the magic word  
            // Uncover the instances of the that letter in the magic word
        // Else, add that guess to display user's attempts
                 and decrease the number of guesses remaining
    
    // Else, Display Game Over Screen and Reset Button

    // render game to screen
